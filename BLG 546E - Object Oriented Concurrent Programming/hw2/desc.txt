 
Assignment 2: Parallel Merge Sort

Prepare a parallelized version of the merge sort where (optionally each split) and sorted merge operation is performed by a different thread. Use barriers to provide synchronization between (splitting) merging threads. At each level of (splitting) merging operations you are expected to set a barrier for all (splitters) mergers to synchronize after finisihng the (split) merge.

Implement the following versions of the algorithm and compare the performance of your implementations on a sufficiently large array with various numbers (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,â€¦) of threads operating on it.
