Hi everybody, our group nama is umansia
I am TuÄŸrul they are Emre and Fatih
we developed simple heart rate sensor gadget and heart rate monitor application for smart phones
1111111111111
we mainly focus on measuring heart rates
users can see their instant heart rate,
also calorie calculation can be done by heart rate so
they can track total burning calories while physical activities or after the activities or sportive acitivites
They can track and schedule (skecul) their sportive activites on their smart phones
So we offer users to simple and cheap solution

on the hardware side
Sensor is integrated on earphones this enhence ease of use
users can use this product as an earphone, actualy its an earphone
Most peaple carries smart phones and listen music via smart phones 
so we combined them
33333333333333
one heart pulse on earlobe blood vessels effects light transmittance through earlobe so
An integrated light sensor on one of the earphones take analog heart pulse signal.
one LED illuminates eralobe and one photransistor senses these pulses
and then small amplifier circuits aplifes the pulse signal
44444444444444
these raw analog signals are transfered to microphone input of the smart phone on earphone cable
And the analog to digital converter of the smart phone reads analogs singnals and converts them into digital data
lastly smart phone proccess these data to find heart rate and calorie consumption
our major advantages are these two items. if we use another circuit to do these jobs 
(I mean not on the smart phone but microprocessor adc) it will probably more complicated and expensive

Now Fatih will continue
