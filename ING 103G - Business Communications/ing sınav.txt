Dear Friends,

As announced before your Final Exam will be on the 10th of May at class hour at the same classroom that we’ve had our lessons all throughout the term.  

I’m planning for a 2 hour exam, but because I’ve missed last week we still have questionnaires to fill and I have to kabul etmek that this process has taken quite long in my Wednesday afternoon class.  

The exam is going to cover only 2 topics: Meetings and the Employment Communication. You can find all necessary information about these topics on pages 148-170 (Meetings) and 172-260 (Employment Communication) in your resource pack. Please, take a closer look at the following topics while studying for your exam:  

Employment Communication:  

    How to write a Cover Letter
    What to include in each paragraph of a cover letter
    Different types of CVs
    Parts of CVs
    How to write acceptable CVs
    Types of Job Interviews
    Typical Job Interview Questions
    How to respond to typical but difficult questions
    How to prepare for the interviews
    What to do and not to do during an interview 

Meetings:

    How to open a formal/informal meeting
    How to close a formal/informal meeting
    Different types of meetings
    How to prepare for meetings
    Parts of meetings
    Roles of a chairperson
    Roles of participants

You should also be familiar with all related vocabulary and terminology on these 2 topics.  

Hope to see you all next week.
