Dear Students,

You are expected to generate random graphs with 50 nodes

with p=0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80 by simulation and study these graphs according to four parameters that are listed below (select four out of the six parameters listed below) by drawing the figures with 95% confidence interval using 5 different random graphs

- edge distribution 

- degree distribution

- size of giant component 

- S, fraction of components in the giant component 

- size of small components

- diameter.

Compare the simulation values with the analytical values and comment.

Good luck,

SFO
